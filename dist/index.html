the mandate to impart undergraduate science education on a research
driven foundation, building resources for our nation’s future of
burgeoning research and development requirements. The Institute has
an Integrated M. Sc. programme to which students are admitted
through a rigorous national level screening test. The students of
the programme get a preliminary grounding training in all major
scientific disciplines for one year, following which they choose a
major discipline for their programme. The students also get
exposure to basic humanities subjects as a part of their programme.
The academic training involves faculty of exceptional track
records, research oriented pedagogy, exposure to advanced
scientific laboratories and techniques, and significant amount of
research projects. We also have very dynamic PhD programmes in
various disciplines, and an Integrated M.Sc–PhD programme. The
institute boasts laboratories with cutting edge technologies in all
major scientific disciplines. All our academic programmes are under

relentless pursuit of excellence by the institute. The maturity,
scientific temper and academic rigour that our students achieve by
the time of graduation render them ideally suited for handling
tomorrow’s research and development challenges of respective
scientific disciplines. Through this message I cordially welcome
all organisations and recruiters to our institute.</p><figcaption class="blockquote-footer">Prof. Sudhakar Panda, Director</figcaption></blockquote></figure></div></div></div></section><!-- About NISER--><section class="section section-components pb-0"><div class="container"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-lg-12"><h2 class="mb-4" id="about-niser"><span>About NISER</span></h2><p>National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER),

institute organised training, students take initiative in
conducting training sessions where hands on skill is imparted,
and organising interdisciplinary talks, inviting speakers from
industry, academia and all walks alike, to interact with and
learn from.</p></div></div></div></section><!-- Skills of students--><section class="bg-secondary pt-4"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8 mx-auto text-center"><h3 class="display-3">Skills of students</h3><p class="lead">Besides mandatory requirements, students are actively encouraged to
participate in professional skill development and networking
activities such as workshops, colloquium, and conferences, making
them well equipped to handle any challenge and perform optimally even
outside their comfort zones.</p></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><!-- Logical and Critical Thinking--><div class="col-md-4"><div class="info"><div class="icon icon-lg icon-shape icon-shape-primary shadow rounded-circle"><i class="ni ni-settings-gear-65"></i></div><h6 class="info-title text-uppercase text-primary">Logical and Critical Thinking</h6><p class="description opacity-8">Critical thinking is fundamentally a process of questioning
information and data; as a part of a research group, every student
has to logically and critically analyze the topic or given unsolved
problems to proceed further.  Many such critical thinking
assignments are part of students' theory and lab courses.</p></div></div><!-- Reading and Study Stratergies--><div class="col-md-4"><div class="info"><div class="icon icon-lg icon-shape icon-shape-success shadow rounded-circle"><i class="ni ni-book-bookmark"></i></div><h6 class="info-title text-uppercase text-success">Reading and Study Strategies</h6><p class="description opacity-8">Due to the rigorous semester coursework and schedules and lab
work that NISER boasts of, students have developed the ability to
proficiently manage time so as to read and prepare for exams as
well as read and analyse research papers to cope up with ongoing
assigned research projects.</p></div></div><!-- Co curricular development--><div class="col-md-4"><div class="info"><div class="icon icon-lg icon-shape icon-shape-warning shadow rounded-circle"><i class="ni ni-compass-04"></i></div><h6 class="info-title text-uppercase text-warning">Co curricular development</h6><p class="description opacity-8">Our student body is less in number as compared to other colleges
and universities, but we participate and organise almost all of
the activities at par with other universities. This leads to the
active involvement of students in more than one dedicated club of
extracurricular activity and managing their activities all year
long.</p></div></div><!-- Research and presentation Skills--><div class="col-md-5"><div class="info"><div class="icon icon-lg icon-shape icon-shape-default shadow rounded-circle"><i class="ni ni-chart-bar-32"></i></div><h6 class="info-title text-uppercase text-default">Research and presentation Skills</h6><p class="description opacity-8">Not only are our students proficient in their research skills,
they are adept at presenting their data in a coherent fashion, an
important skill to excel in their daily coursework and projects.
While some people take this in their stride, others find it much
more challenging initially, which they ultimately overcome by the
time they graduate with their thesis.</p></div></div><!-- Writing and Communication Skills--><div class="col-md-5"><div class="info"><div class="icon icon-lg icon-shape icon-shape-info shadow rounded-circle"><i class="ni ni-align-center"></i></div><h6 class="info-title text-uppercase text-info">Writing and Communication Skills</h6><p class="description opacity-8">In the course of the program, everyone has to do research and
write a thesis at the end of last semester. This process not only
hones their research acumen but also leads to better
communication skills, written or otherwise-working as a team,
continually communicating with their lab members, PI and thesis
committee. Even as part of our coursework and exams, which do not
merely test our memory, but also our understanding and how well
we can convey the solution efficiently, is a testament to
students’ communication skills.</p></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8 mx-auto text-center pb-2"><p class="lead">NISER is well equipped with state-of-the-art research facilities at
par with global standards, such as the NMR spectrometer, multiple

X-Ray diffractometers, field emission scanning microscopes,
ultrafast laser systems, EPR facility, and many more.</p></div></div></div></section><!-- Placement Procedure--><section class="pb-5"><div class="container"><div class="row mt-4"><div class="col-md-8 mx-auto text-center"><h3 class="display-3"><a href="./placement-procedure.html">Placement Procedure</a></h3></div></div><div class="nav-wrapper"><ul class="nav nav-pills nav-pills-circle" id="pp" role="tab-list"><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link mb-sm-3 mb-md-0 active" id="pp-1-tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#pp-1" aria-controls="pp-1" aria-selected="true">1</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" id="pp-2-tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#pp-2" aria-controls="pp-2" aria-selected="false">2</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link mb-sm-3 mb-md-0" id="pp-3-tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#pp-3" aria-controls="pp-3" aria-selected="false">3</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link mb-sm-3 mb-md-0" id="pp-4-tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#pp-4" aria-controls="pp-4" aria-selected="false">4</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link mb-sm-3 mb-md-0" id="pp-5-tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#pp-5" aria-controls="pp-5" aria-selected="false">5</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link mb-sm-3 mb-md-0" id="pp-6-tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#pp-6" aria-controls="pp-6" aria-selected="false">6</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link mb-sm-3 mb-md-0" id="pp-7-tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#pp-7" aria-controls="pp-7" aria-selected="false">7</a></li></ul></div><div class="card shadow bg-secondary" style="transform: translateY(-10%)"><div class="card-body"><div class="text-center tab-content"><div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="pp-1" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pp-1-tab"><p class="lead">Placement cell invites companies to the campus.</p></div><div class="tab-pane fade" id="pp-2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pp-2-tab"><p class="lead">Companies/Organizations will have to fill a Job Notification
